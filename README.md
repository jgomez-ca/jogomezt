- 👋 Hi, I’m @jogomezt
- 👀 I’m interested in web design, user experience interaction research and design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about CSS, JS (and different frameworks), PHP, SQL, Mongo, Python, and really trying C++ (as a personal challenge)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects
- 📫 How to reach me? Easy, drop a line...
